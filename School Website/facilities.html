<h2>Learning Management System(LMS)</h2>
<img src="http://bhavansalain.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/LMS-1024x514.png" height="300" width="350">
<p>Bhavans in Al Ain is a forerunner in the field of Child Centered Education. At Bhavans, we believe that a child’s latent potential can be developed only through multi-dimensional teaching and learning process. Implementation of Learning Management System was one of the measures taken by our Chairman, Mr. N.K. Ramachandran Menon, to provide effective and enriching learning experience to young learners in Bhavans Schools all over the Middle East.</p>
<p>Learning Management system is a very effective web based tool devised to provide the learners with a virtual learning environment. It allows pedagogues to manage their courses and exchange information with their students. The most remarkable feature of LMS is the web based or blended course delivery. With the state of the art e-platform incorporating HD projectors and 24/7 internet connectivity at the fully digitized campus, teachers effectively deliver the course contents ensuring active participation of the students. Using this advanced platform, teachers can grade their students’ performance online. A comprehensive and complete performance report of students is made available to the parents using this cutting-edge learning platform. This enables the parents to track the progress of their children even from the coziness of their office cubicles.</p>
<p>LMS provides the learners with an array of audio and visual stimuli pertaining to the topics. Be it Science, English, Math or Social Science, a compendium of videos, documentaries, fact sheets, biographies and other learning materials carefully chosen and designed by teachers trained by IT professionals from India are available for students to provide them with a complete learning experience.</p>
<p>LMS and Digital Campus are the other milestones on the path of Bhavan’s dedication and determination to provide world-class education to the young learners, enabling them to emerge as successful global citizens of the modern world.</p>
